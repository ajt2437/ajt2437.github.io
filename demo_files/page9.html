    <h1>Rounded borders</h1>

    <p><span class="note">Note:</span> The <span class="method">border-radius</span> property is not supported in IE8 and earlier versions.</p>

    <h1>CSS margins</h1>

    <h2>The auto Value</h2>
    <p>This is to horizontally center the element within its container.</p>

    <p>The element will then take up the specified width and the remaining space will be equally divided between the left and right margins</p>

    <h2>Margin Collapse</h2>

    <p>Top and bottom margins of elements are sometimes collapsed into a single margin that is equal to the largest of the two margins.</p>

    <p>This does not happen on left and right margins! <span class="note">Only top and bottom margins!</span></p>

    <h1>CSS Padding</h1>

    <p>To keep a fixed width, no matter the amount of padding, you can use the <span class="method">box-sizing: border-box</span> property. This causes the element to maintain its width; if you increase the padding, the available content space will decrease.
    </p>

    <h1>CSS Width and Height</h1>

    <p><span class="note">Note:</span> The value of the <span class="method">max-width</span> property overrides <span class="method">width</span>.</p>

    <h1>CSS Outline</h1>

    <p><span class="note">Note:</span> Outline differs from borders! Unlike border, the outline is drawn outside the element's border, and may overlap other content. Also, the outline is NOT a part of the element's dimensions; the element's total width and
        height is not affected by the width of the outline.</p>

    <p><span class="note">Note:</span> None of the other outline properties will have any effect, unless the outline-style property is set!</p>

    <p>The <span class="method">outline-offset</span> property adds space between an outline and the edge/border of an element.</p>

    <h1>Text formatting</h1>

    <p>When the <span class="method">text-align</span> property is set to "justify", each line is stretched so that every line has equal width, and the left and right margins are straight</p>

    <h2>Text transform</h2>

    <p>The <span class="method">text-transform</span> property is used to specify uppercase and lowercase letters in a text.</p>

    <h2>Text indent</h2>

    <h2>Letter spacing</h2>

    <h2>Line height</h2>

    <h2>Text Direction</h2>

    <h2>Word spacing</h2>

    <h2>White space</h2>
    <p>To disable word wrapping set the property value <span class="method">white-space: no wrap;</span></p>

    <h2>Vertical align</h2>

    <h1>CSS Fonts</h1>

    <h2>Font Family</h2>

    <p>The <span class="method">font-family</span> property should hold several font names as a "fallback" system. If the browser does not support the first font, it tries the next font, and so on.</p>

    <p>Start with the font you want, and end with a generic family, to let the browser pick a similar font in the generic family, if no other fonts are available. </p>

    <p><span class="note">Note:</span> If the name of a font family is more than one word, it must be in quotation marks, like: "Times New Roman".</p>

    <p>More than one font family is specified in a comma-separated list:</p>

    <pre>
        p {
            font-family: "Times New Roman", Times, serif;
        }
    </pre>
