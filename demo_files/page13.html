    <h1>CSS Flexbox</h1>

    <p>By adding the property <span class="method">display: flex</span> to any element, by default, it aligns them horizontally in the same row and gives them equal height (based on the element with the greatest height)</p>

    <h2>Use the flex-direction Property to Make a Row</h2>

    <p>Adding <span class="method">display: flex</span> to an element turns it into a flex container. This makes it possible to align any children of that element into rows or columns. You do this by adding the <span class="method">flex-direction</span>        property to the parent item and setting it to row or column. Creating a row will align the children horizontally, and creating a column will align the children vertically.</p>

    <p>Other options for <span class="method">flex-direction</span> are row-reverse and column-reverse.</p>

    <h2>Align Elements Using the justify-content Property</h2>

    <img src="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/images/flex-direction-terms.svg" alt="flex container align">

    <p>Recall that setting a flex container as a row places the flex items side-by-side from left-to-right. A flex container set as a column places the flex items in a vertical stack from top-to-bottom. For each, the direction the flex items are arranged
        is called the <b>main axis</b>. For a row, this is a horizontal line that cuts through each item. And for a column, the main axis is a vertical line through the items.</p>

    <!-- <span class="method"> -->
    <p>There are several options for how to space the flex items along the line that is the main axis. One of the most commonly used is <span class="method">justify-content: center;</span>, which aligns all the flex items to the center inside the flex container.
        Others options include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="method">flex-start</span>: aligns items to the start of the flex container. For a row, this pushes the items to the left of the container. For a column, this pushes the items to the top of the container.</li>
        <li><span class="method">flex-end</span>: aligns items to the end of the flex container. For a row, this pushes the items to the right of the container. For a column, this pushes the items to the bottom of the container.</li>
        <li><span class="method">space-between</span>: aligns items to the center of the main axis, with extra space placed between the items. The first and last items are pushed to the very edge of the flex container. For example, in a row the first item
            is against the left side of the container, the last item is against the right side of the container, then the other items between them are spaced evenly.</li>
        <li><span class="method">space-around</span>: similar to <span class="method">space-between</span> but the first and last items are not locked to the edges of the container, the space is distributed around all the items</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Align Elements Using the align-items Property</h2>

    <p>Flex containers also have a <b>cross axis</b> which is the opposite of the main axis. For rows, the cross axis is vertical and for columns, the cross axis is horizontal.</p>

    <p>CSS offers the <span class="method">align-items</span> property to align flex items along the cross axis. For a row, it tells CSS how to push the items in the entire row up or down within the container. And for a column, how to push all the items
        left or right within the container.</p>

    <p>The differenct values available include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><span class="method">flex-start</span>: aligns items to the start of the flex container. For rows, this aligns items to the top of the container. For columns, this aligns items to the left of the container.</li>
        <li><span class="method">flex-end</span>: aligns items to the end of the flex container. For rows, this aligns items to the bottom of the container. For columns, this aligns items to the right of the container.</li>
        <li><span class="method">center</span>: align items to the center. For rows, this vertically aligns items (equal space above and below the items). For columns, this horizontally aligns them (equal space to the left and right of the items).</li>
        <li><span class="method">stretch</span>: stretch the items to fill the flex container. For example, rows items are stretched to fill the flex container top-to-bottom.</li>
        <li><span class="method">baseline</span>: align items to their baselines. Baseline is a text concept, think of it as the line that the letters sit on.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Use the flex-wrap Property to Wrap a Row or Column</h2>

    <p>CSS flexbox has a feature to split a flex item into multiple rows (or columns). By default, a flex container will fit all flex items together. For example, a row will all be on one line.</p>

    <p>However, using the flex-wrap property, it tells CSS to wrap items. This means extra items move into a new row or column. The break point of where the wrapping happens depends on the size of the items and the size of the container.</p>

    <p>CSS also has options for the direction of the wrap:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><span class="method">nowrap</span>: this is the default setting, and does not wrap items.</li>
        <li><span class="method">wrap</span>: wraps items from left-to-right if they are in a row, or top-to-bottom if they are in a column.</li>
        <li><span class="method">wrap-reverse</span>: wraps items from bottom-to-top if they are in a row, or right-to-left if they are in a column.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Use the flex-shrink Property to Shrink Items</h2>

    <p>This property allows an item to shrink if the flex container is too small.</p>

    <p>Items shrink when parent.width &lt; flex.totalWidth</p>

    <p>It takes numbers as values. The higher the number the greater the shrinking. Example: If one item has a <span class="method">flex-shrink</span> value of 1 and the other has a <span class="method">flex-shrink</span> value of 5, the one with the value
        of 5 will shrink five times as much as the other.</p>

    <h2>Use the flex-grow Property to Expand Items</h2>

    <p>The <span class="method">flex-grow</span> property controls the size of items when the parent container expands.</p>

    <p>Using a similar example from before, if one item has a <span class="method">flex-grow</span> value of 1 and the other has a <span class="method">flex-grow</span> value of 5, the one with the value of 5 will grow five times as much as the other.</p>

    <h2>Use the flex-basis Property to Set the Initial Size of an Item</h2>

    <p>The <span class="method">flex-basis</span> property specifies the initial size of the item before CSS makes adjustments with <span class="method">flex-shrink</span> or <span class="method">flex-grow</span>.</p>

    <p>The units used by the <span class="method">flex-basis</span> property are the same as other size properties <span class="method">(px, em, %, etc.)</span>. The value <span class="method">auto</span> sizes items based on the content.</p>

    <h2>Use the flex Shorthand Property</h2>

    <p>The <span class="method">flex-grow</span>, <span class="method">flex-shrink</span>, and <span class="method">flex-basis</span> properties can all be set together by using the <span class="method">flex</span> property.</p>
    <span class="method">flex: 1 0 10px;</span>

    <p>The syntax goes as follows:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><span class="method">flex-grow</span></li>
        <li><span class="method">flex-shrink</span></li>
        <li><span class="method">flex-basis</span></li>
    </ul>

    <p>The default property settings are <span class="method">flex: 0 1 auto;</span>.</p>

    <h2>Use the order Property to Rearrange Items</h2>

    <p>The order property is used to tell CSS the order of how flex items appear in the flex container. The property takes numbers as values, and negative numbers can be used.</p>

    <h2>Use the align-self Property</h2>

    <p>This property allows you to adjust each item's alignment individually, instead of setting them all at once.</p>

    <p><span class="method">align-self</span> accepts the same values as <span class="method">align-items</span> and will override any value set by the <span class="method">align-items</span> property.</p>
